    ai_function: a function returning either two strings or two lists.
        If two strings, the first one is the action to perform (either "move" or "switch")
        and the second is the target of the action (an attack name if "move" or a pok√©mon name if "switch").
        If 'singles' is False, the decision is expected to be used for doubles.
        Therefore, the function is expected to return a list of two actions and a list of two targets
        (a pair action-target is determined by their index number).
    singles: a boolean. True if the battle format is singles and False if doubles
    kwargs: the arguments needed for ai_function
